# What is it?

TVGuideLayout allows you to display items in a traditional TV Guide style schedule view. It is built from a UICollectionViewLayout subclass. You can either use this layout directly in your project, or you can use the provided TVGuideViewController, which provides an out of the box setup.

The project was built to be composable, such that you may easily include or modify components to meet your needs. The alternative would be to create a UICollectionViewLayout subclass that is highly configurable.

# Features
- Sticky headers, which compress as the user scrolls to the right.
- Vertical time bar that updates it's position as time updates.
- UICollectionViewDiffableSource integration.

# Examples

An example with local mock data is provided for guidance.
